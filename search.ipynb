      "1. Introduction\n",
      "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\n",
      "evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\n",
      "towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\n",
      "Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\n",
      "It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\n",
      "to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\n",
      "pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\n",
      "were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\n",
      "Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\n",
      "reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\n",
      "of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\n",
      "works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\n",
      "et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\n",
      "and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\n",
      "et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\n",
      "performance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\n",
      "In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\n",
      "using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\n",
      "reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\n",
      "a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\n",
      "GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\n",
      "During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\n",
      "reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\n",
      "on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\n",
      "71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\n",
      "of OpenAI-o1-0912.\n",
      "However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\n",
      "mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\n",
      "DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\n",
      "pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\n",
      "DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\n",
      "Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\n",
      "sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\n",
      "such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\n",
      "After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\n",
      "into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\n",
      "as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\n",
      "We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\n",
      "32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\n",
      "RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\n",
      "cial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\n",
      "et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\n",
      "QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\n",
      "new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\n",
      "3\n",
      "1.1. Contributions\n",
      "Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\n",
      "• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\n",
      "a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\n",
      "solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\n",
      "R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\n",
      "long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\n",
      "first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\n",
      "purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\n",
      "advancements in this area.\n",
      "• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\n",
      "stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\n",
      "erences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and\n",
      "non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating\n",
      "better models.\n",
      "Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\n",
      "• We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller\n",
      "models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered\n",
      "through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit\n",
      "the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\n",

      "4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts\n",
      "In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along\n",
      "the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that\n",
      "these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\n",
      "Process Reward Model (PRM)\n",
      "PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better\n",
      "approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\n",
      "2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\n",
      "cess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\n",
      "determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\n",

      "ducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\n",
      "hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\n",
      "and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\n",
      "ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\n",
      "et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\n",
      "introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\n",
      "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
      "Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-\n",
      "ver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time\n",
      "compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\n",
      "model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\n",
      "generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\n",
      "training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\n",
      "model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\n",
      "and the value model, iteratively refining the process.\n",
      "However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,\n",
      "unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\n",
      "15\n",
      "exponentially larger search space. To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\n",
      "node, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\n",
      "directly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\n",
      "Training a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\n",
      "model to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to\n",
      "progressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\n",
      "due to the complexities of token generation.\n",
      "In conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\n",
      "pre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\n",
      "significant challenge.\n",
      "5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\n",
      "In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\n",
      "learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\n",
      "data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\n",
      "leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves\n",
      "performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\n",
      "We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use\n",
      "DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small\n",
      "dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o\n",
      "and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other\n",
      "dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-\n",
      "tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\n",
      "In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\n",
      "• General Capability: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3\n",
      "in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output.\n",
      "Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in\n",
      "these fields.\n",
      "• Language Mixing: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which\n",
      "may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For\n",
      "instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is\n",
      "in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future\n",
      "updates.\n",
      "• Prompting Engineering: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive\n",
      "to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we\n",
      "recommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a\n",
      "zero-shot setting for optimal results.\n",
      "• Software Engineering Tasks: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the effi-\n",
      "ciency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software\n",
      "engineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement\n",
      "over DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address\n",
      "this by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating\n",
      "asynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.\n",

      "What is group relative policy optimization\n",
      " Group relative policy optimization refers to the process of developing policies or decision-making strategies for groups of agents or entities, taking into account the relative needs, preferences, or behaviors within the group. The objective is to find the best approach that maximizes overall group utility, considers the diversity of preferences among group members, and takes into account any interdependencies or relationships between group members.\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of policy optimization is particularly relevant in scenarios where agents are interdependent and interact with each other, such as in multi-agent systems, resource allocation, transportation planning, and cooperative tasks. By optimizing policies at the group level, decision-makers can improve the overall performance of the system, enhance fairness and equity for individual group members, and reduce potential conflicts or disagreements among group members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key components of group relative policy optimization:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Evaluation of group utility: Group utility is typically measured by aggregating the individual utilities of the group members, taking into consideration the relative importance of each member, preferences, and potential interdependencies.\n",
      "2. Fairness and equity: Since individual group members might have different preferences or needs, it's essential to consider fairness and equity in policy optimization. This might involve balancing different objectives, such as equity (fairness) and efficiency (maximizing overall group utility).\n",
      "3. Decision-making approaches: Various techniques can be used to optimize policies for groups, including game theory, cooperative multi-agent systems, and social welfare functions. These approaches often require a trade-off between the individual and group objectives.\n",
      "4. Individual autonomy: Group relative policy optimization still considers the choices and preferences of individual group members. The policies developed should be flexible enough to accommodate the needs and decisions of individual group members while maximizing overall group utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applications of group relative policy optimization include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Resource allocation: optimizing policies for allocating resources among multiple group members (e.g., task allocation, budget distribution, etc.) to maximize overall group utility.\n",
      "2. Transportation planning: determining the best combination of routes, schedules, and modes of transport to optimize transportation costs, travel times, and individual preferences while minimizing congestion and environmental impact.\n",
      "3. Policymaking: developing policies for promoting collective behaviors (e.g., carbon reduction, energy conservation, etc.) that improve overall group welfare while balancing individual preferences and constraints.\n",
      "4. Workforce management: designing policies for group collaboration, communication, and delegation while considering individual skills, motivations, and preferences.\n",

      "What rewards are used in DeepSeek-R1-Zero\n",
      " I'm sorry, but based on my current knowledge, there isn't a specific AI model called DeepSeek-R1-Zero. It may be a typo, a new model you're referring to, or an implementation that hasn't been widely publicized yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can provide you with general information on the rewards that are typically used in RL (Reinforcement Learning) models. As the architecture, methodology, and creators of a deep learning model can differ greatly, the specific rewards may also vary between projects. But let's look at some conventional rewards employed in the RL framework that might present some insight in the context of a model like DeepSeek (which itself seems to be speculative or fictional in this scenario):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reward function**: This is the primary way through which an agent learns to perform tasks. The function maps the agent’s action, state, and possible outcomes to a scalar value that guides the agent towards what it should do (reward) or away from what it shouldn't (penalty). \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exploration vs exploitation**: A common dilemma in reinforcement learning models where an optimal balance needs to be maintained between trying new actions (exploration) and following actions that are already known to yield good results (exploitation). Reward shaping can be used to control this balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sparse and dense rewards**: Deep reinforcement learning models can operate with sparse or dense reward signals. Sparse rewards provide feedback less frequently, while dense rewards give the agent feedback for every or almost every action. A hybrid of both might also be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Penalties or negative rewards**: These discourage the agent from performing actions that extract undesirable outcomes. Penalties can encourage the agent to refrain from bad behaviors (e.g., guessing too early during a binary classification problem).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bootstrapping and Tempoal Credit Assignment**: In contexts where rewards can't be observed immediately after an action, it's crucial to distribute the associated reward back to the agent for past actions that led to the ultimate result. This selection process of assigning credit is called temporal credit assignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Using Rewards to Encourage Different Game Styles**: In more complex problem scenarios, same reward can be used to train the model differently or encourage different strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Monitoring Critical variables**: To evaluate your overall progress beyond just the raw reward, it might sometimes be beneficial to build upon the reward function and/or include status-tracking additional reward indicators.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could thus speculate about a deep reinforcement learning model titled DeepSeek-R1-Zero and would probably use similar reward strategies for encouraging desirable behavior as mentioned above. However, the specific methodologies, from exploration algorithms, learning rate, reward signal, or neural network design would largely be dependent on the task it's designed to solve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the effectiveness of reward structures in reinforcement learning is task-dependent - it's crucial to carefully define the reward signal based on the problem domain for the model to learn efficiently and perform optimally. If the DeepSeek-R1-Zero model exists, guidance from its authors or expositions related to it will offer more intricate details about its reward structure and implementation.\n",

      " Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an advanced machine learning technique that focuses on optimizing a policy in a cooperative manner within a group. It's often associated with the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where several agents work together to achieve their common goal. In a typical reinforcement learning setting, agents typically learn independently and compete with each other. However, in GRPO, we aim for healthy inter-agent collaboration, which could improve the overall system performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy: In Machine Learning and especially Reinforcement Learning, a policy refers to the agent's way or approach of behaving at a given time. It defines an action that an agent should take, given a certain state of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimization: In the world of AI, optimization refers to improving the performance of a system or model. It's about making a system work more efficiently, accurately, or fairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relative Policy Optimization: It's a specific type of reinforcement learning where a new policy is learned relative to an existing policy. The process seeks to optimize the new policy while considering the performance of the existing policy on the same tasks. The idea is to ensure that the new policy improves the outcomes compared to the old policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group Relative Policy Optimization: When we talk about a group of policies, GRPO becomes particularly relevant. GRPO happens in scenarios where multiple policies (or agents) work together to achieve a collective goal. Each policy (or agent) strives to outperform the others relative to their previous performances, but they also work collectively, aiming to attain an optimal group performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, in a multiple-agent cooperative setting, such as autonomous vehicles picking up goods from different delivery spots, GRPO could be used to train each vehicle's policy to not only optimize its own route but also to work harmoniously with other vehicles' routes to ensure a timely and efficient operation system-wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this might seem challenging given the need for coordination and cooperation among different agents, GRPO methodologies provide a structured way to achieve this. By using harmonic function coding (which ensures agents' policies complement each other) and message passing (which promotes communication and collective decision-making among agents), GRPO helps guide the learning process towards a common goal — maximising the group's overall reward function. The reward function is a crucial component in reinforcement learning that guides and incentivises certain behaviours. In the GRPO methodology, this reward function would be set up to reinforce actions that increase the group's collective reward.\n",

      " LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion Model) is an innovative framework presented for large language modeling. Its unique approach stems from utilizing diffusion models, which are part of a class of generative models that iteratively transform a distribution of noise into a coherent output or data sample. LLaDA stands out because it is the first to apply these diffusion models to natural language processing effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The main contributions and features of LLaDA include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scalability:** LLaDA can be scaled up to handle larger datasets and generate more complex language patterns due to its diffusion-based architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **In-context Learning:** This denotes the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on the context provided by the preceding text. LLaDA demonstrates this capability quite effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Instruction Following:** LLaDA can perform tasks that require understanding complex instructions and generating appropriate responses, challenging the performance of previous models but without the requirement of pre-trained instruction-following models.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Bidirectionality:** LLaDA's design enables it to interpret language in both directions, making it a more versatile model when it comes to question answering or conversational AI tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Robustness:** LLaDA exhibits increased robustness when compared to traditional autoregressive models (ARMs), withstanding various perturbations and reducing issues such as hallucination (generating plausible-sounding but untrue information).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Positive Impact of Biases:** LLaDA's diffusion model framework embraces and isolates biases during the training process, leading to more transparent and understandable model behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, studies comparing LLaDA with more conventional autoregressive language models (ARMs) such as GPT-3 show similar or comparable performance, yet offer additional advantages. Notably, these benefits could make diffusion-based models a popular choice for future language models, given their unique properties.\n",
